# Domain-Level Behavior Analysis

## Domain Summary

The `rest-news` service is described by its OpenAPI contract as: Some description

The core business concepts are:

- country-api: endpoint group for country api behavior.
- news-rest-api: endpoint group for news rest api behavior.

Contract-level limits: this document captures externally visible business behavior from the API contract. Implementation-only validation, persistence side effects, authorization rules, and asynchronous processing details may be stricter than what is visible here.

## Supported Business Behaviors

### Behavior 1: Retrieve List Of Country Names

Business goal:
Retrieve list of country names.

Domain context:
This behavior belongs to the `country-api` capability area and operates through `GET /countries`.

Starting point:
Any service state that satisfies the declared path parameters. For collection reads, the backing store may be empty.

Required execution workflow:
1. Use function `retrieve list of country names` (`GET /countries`) with no request parameters or body declared.

Optional verification workflow:
None. The behavior itself is a read or inspection operation.

Existing-state shortcuts:
- Direct database or fixture setup can create records before invoking the read if a non-empty response is needed.

Parameter and value bindings:
- No request values are reused by later steps according to the OpenAPI contract.

Business result:
No state changes are expected. The response returns the requested resource, collection, calculation, or status view.

Constraints and invariants:
- No required primitive parameters are declared in the OpenAPI contract.
- Authentication, authorization, and cross-resource consistency are implementation concerns unless explicitly documented by the endpoint responses.

Failure and exceptional cases:
- Failing function: `retrieve list of country names`
  - Failure condition: HTTP `401` response.
  - Why it fails: Unauthorized
  - Violated prerequisite or constraint: The request does not satisfy service validation, authorization, existence, or state-transition rules for this endpoint.
- Failing function: `retrieve list of country names`
  - Failure condition: HTTP `403` response.
  - Why it fails: Forbidden
  - Violated prerequisite or constraint: The request does not satisfy service validation, authorization, existence, or state-transition rules for this endpoint.
- Failing function: `retrieve list of country names`
  - Failure condition: HTTP `404` response.
  - Why it fails: Not Found
  - Violated prerequisite or constraint: The request does not satisfy service validation, authorization, existence, or state-transition rules for this endpoint.

Implementation notes:
Success responses: 200 OK. Failure responses: 401 Unauthorized; 403 Forbidden; 404 Not Found.

### Behavior 2: Get All The News

Business goal:
Get all the news.

Domain context:
This behavior belongs to the `news-rest-api` capability area and operates through `GET /news`.

Starting point:
Any service state that satisfies the declared path parameters. For collection reads, the backing store may be empty.

Required execution workflow:
1. Use function `get all the news` (`GET /news`) with query: authorId optional, country optional.

Optional verification workflow:
None. The behavior itself is a read or inspection operation.

Existing-state shortcuts:
- Direct database or fixture setup can create records before invoking the read if a non-empty response is needed.

Parameter and value bindings:
- Query values `authorId`, `country` filter, page, or modify the operation result.

Business result:
No state changes are expected. The response returns the requested resource, collection, calculation, or status view.

Constraints and invariants:
- No required primitive parameters are declared in the OpenAPI contract.
- Authentication, authorization, and cross-resource consistency are implementation concerns unless explicitly documented by the endpoint responses.

Failure and exceptional cases:
- Failing function: `get all the news`
  - Failure condition: HTTP `401` response.
  - Why it fails: Unauthorized
  - Violated prerequisite or constraint: The request does not satisfy service validation, authorization, existence, or state-transition rules for this endpoint.

Implementation notes:
Success responses: 200 OK. Failure responses: 401 Unauthorized; 403 Forbidden; 404 Not Found.

### Behavior 3: Create A News

Business goal:
Create a news.

Domain context:
This behavior belongs to the `news-rest-api` capability area and operates through `POST /news`.

Starting point:
The caller has prepared all required path parameters and any required request body or form fields. Parent resources referenced by the path should already exist when the domain requires them.

Required execution workflow:
1. Use function `create a news` (`POST /news`) with body: dto optional.

Optional verification workflow:
1. Use the corresponding read/list function for the same resource, when available, to verify the persisted or computed state.

Existing-state shortcuts:
- Direct setup can create parent resources referenced by path values before invoking this function.
- Reusing an already-existing target may be accepted, rejected, or treated idempotently depending on implementation validation.

Parameter and value bindings:
- No request values are reused by later steps according to the OpenAPI contract.

Business result:
The service creates, imports, starts, or executes the requested business action. Returned identifiers or links can be reused in later resource-specific calls when present.

Constraints and invariants:
- No required primitive parameters are declared in the OpenAPI contract.
- Authentication, authorization, and cross-resource consistency are implementation concerns unless explicitly documented by the endpoint responses.

Failure and exceptional cases:
- Failing function: `create a news`
  - Failure condition: HTTP `401` response.
  - Why it fails: Unauthorized
  - Violated prerequisite or constraint: The request does not satisfy service validation, authorization, existence, or state-transition rules for this endpoint.
- Failing function: `create a news`
  - Failure condition: HTTP `403` response.
  - Why it fails: Forbidden
  - Violated prerequisite or constraint: The request does not satisfy service validation, authorization, existence, or state-transition rules for this endpoint.
- Failing function: `create a news`
  - Failure condition: HTTP `404` response.
  - Why it fails: Not Found
  - Violated prerequisite or constraint: The request does not satisfy service validation, authorization, existence, or state-transition rules for this endpoint.

Implementation notes:
Success responses: 200 OK; 201 Created. Failure responses: 401 Unauthorized; 403 Forbidden; 404 Not Found.

### Behavior 4: Get A Single News Specified By Id

Business goal:
Get a single news specified by id.

Domain context:
This behavior belongs to the `news-rest-api` capability area and operates through `GET /news/{id}`.

Starting point:
Any service state that satisfies the declared path parameters. For collection reads, the backing store may be empty.

Required execution workflow:
1. Use function `get a single news specified by id` (`GET /news/{id}`) with path: id optional.

Optional verification workflow:
None. The behavior itself is a read or inspection operation.

Existing-state shortcuts:
- Direct database or fixture setup can create records before invoking the read if a non-empty response is needed.

Parameter and value bindings:
- Path values `id` identify the business resource scope for the operation.

Business result:
No state changes are expected. The response returns the requested resource, collection, calculation, or status view.

Constraints and invariants:
- No required primitive parameters are declared in the OpenAPI contract.
- Authentication, authorization, and cross-resource consistency are implementation concerns unless explicitly documented by the endpoint responses.

Failure and exceptional cases:
